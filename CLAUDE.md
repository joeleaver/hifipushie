# hifipushie

MCP server for LLM-driven character/creature modeling. The design principle: give the model
representations it reasons well in (skeletons, named parts, numbers) and feedback it can act on
(consistent multi-view renders, rulers, numeric silhouette errors), not mouse control.

## Layout
- `src/hifipushie/spec.py`: spec format, ".L" → ".R" mirroring, compile to primitives. Read its docstring first.
- `sdf.py`: numpy SDFs (round cone, ellipsoid), smooth union/subtract, narrow-band grid eval (8³ blocks,
  exact only where the surface can be), marching cubes, Taubin smoothing, then `project`: Newton-steps
  vertices onto the exact field and takes normals from its gradient (renders/OBJ use these normals).
  Clipping uses `Prim.reach`/`inert` from `spec._set_reach`: a primitive may only be skipped where neither
  its own blend nor a later overlapping primitive's blend can see it. Flat bones and flat ellipsoids
  under-report distance, so their reach is scaled up. Break that and you get flat seams in fillets.
- `kits.py`: parametric parts (`hand`, `face`) stored under `spec["kits"]`, expanded into ordinary
  joints/bones/blobs before mirroring (`spec.expand_mirror` calls `kits.expand`). The face kit seats
  features onto the kit-free body by raycasting the field, so they follow skull edits. Eyelids are the
  `"shape": "lids"` blob (`sdf.sd_lids`: solid cap with a radial almond opening, never a thin sheet).
  Kit defaults keep details a few voxels wide at close-up resolution: sub-voxel creases render as zigzags.
  Chains (fingers, lips) are many short segments in one `group` (`sdf.units`): joined by hard min (or a
  small `join`), then blended into the body once. Per-segment smooth unions bulge at every joint.
- `strokes.py`: sculpting on the surface. A stroke's path is addressed on the kit-expanded, stroke-free body
  (out from a bone axis, or a raycast), resampled on a Catmull-Rom curve and re-seated, and becomes a
  "displace" or "flatten" blob: an op "modify" primitive (`sdf.MODS`) that reshapes the field combined so far
  instead of unioning a shape. A stroke is a normalised sum of dabs along its densely resampled path (each
  depth * profile(distance across the surface / width)), like a sculpt brush: measuring from the nearest point
  of the polyline instead kinks the surface at every sample (stripes in raking light/curvature). Seated paths
  and normals are Gaussian-smoothed along the path (normals over lids/nostrils swing and streak deep strokes).
  Width/depth ease between control points (smoothstep). Modifiers make the field steeper than 1 (`Prim.lip`); `evaluate` widens its
  band by the max lip.
- `render.py` + `blender_render.py`: headless Blender workbench/matcap renders, contact sheet with rulers.
  `look(strokes=True)` draws stroke paths (visibility by raycasting the field); `shading="raking"` uses a
  generated low-side-light matcap, `"curvature"` colours vertices by the field's Laplacian (convex warm).
  `smin` is cubic (C2): the quadratic one left curvature jumps at every fillet edge, visible in highlights.
- `measure.py`: cross-sections of the exact field (`sdf.field_at`): rays from a bone axis, or world-axis slices.
- `compare.py`: reference mask extraction, placement (FFT shift search per scale + sub-pixel refine, kept as a
  continuous transform onto the full-res image), diff image, band tables.
- `fit.py`: silhouette auto-fit. Levenberg-Marquardt on a symmetric outline chamfer; Jacobian columns come from
  `field_at(clip=False)` at each outline point's closest-approach depth (envelope theorem), so no autodiff.
- `plan.py`: the 2D blockout plan (`spec["plan"]`): per-view unions of 2D shapes in world units, landmarks,
  sections. `reference()` rasterises a view with its world placement; `compare.place(world=...)` puts it on
  the model canvas exactly (no scale search), so `check`/`compare`/`fit` with against="plan" measure real
  size errors. Workflow stages (plan → blockout → secondary forms → detail) are in the server INSTRUCTIONS.
- `store.py`: `workspace/<model>/spec.json` + `history/`, build cache keyed by spec hash.
- `server.py`: MCP tools (mcp 2.x `MCPServer`, not v1 FastMCP).

## Conventions
Metres, Blender axes: Z up, creature faces -Y, its left is +X. Side view shows it facing left.

Second test subject: `workspace/goblin` (upright biped, big face, hands), so we don't tune for the fox alone.
Bump `store.BUILD_VERSION` whenever meshing output changes; the build cache is keyed on the kit-expanded
spec + resolution. `look` with focus + zoom builds only a box around the focus (`build(box=...)`, its own
`closeup.npz`), with `resolution` counted across that box.

## Testing without restarting the MCP
Call the tool functions directly: `uv run python -c "from hifipushie import server; ..."`;
`look` returns `[Image, str]` and `Image.data` is PNG bytes you can write to a file.

OpenBLAS is capped at 4 threads in `__init__.py`: uncapped, 100x100 solves take ~300 ms on a 24-core box.

## Roadmap (next, roughly in priority order)
1. ~~Auto-fit~~ done (`fit`). Possible follow-ups: soft priors (keep paws/ears proportioned), fitting
   `flat`/`rot`, re-placing the reference between rounds.
2. Surface picking: grid-labelled render → raycast a cell to a 3D surface point.
3. Sculpt pass on the baked mesh: deterministic strokes (inflate/crease/smooth/flatten) along 3D paths,
   on named regions, symmetric.
4. ~~Face/hand kits~~ done (`kits.py`). Follow-ups: ears (needs a leaf/blade primitive: `flat` cones
   are round), muzzle for snouted faces, pupils/iris, lips follow cheek lumps a little too faithfully.
5. Adaptive resolution near small features. Projection + gradient normals fixed most aliasing; what's
   left is topology the grid can't hold (sub-voxel wedges, e.g. where an eyeball meets its socket).
   Needs real local refinement (finer blocks where the band is thin), or a model-side fix.
6. Skeleton → Blender armature for posing; push the result into a live Blender session.
