# The GNM model atlas (facesliders, 2026-10-09)

Joe: "Every hand-made slider we made should control the model as a whole. Nothing should really work in isolation.
We need to comprehend the model." Step 1 of the redesign: what GNM's identity space can express, and what moves
together in the faces it makes.

Scripts (spikes/facesliders/): `atlas.py <n>` samples heads from GNM's identity prior (the 120 head components,
N(0, 1)) and measures every attribute we have a slider or a checklist item for: humanmacro's 37 macros + 17 of ours
(lid, lip, nose, jaw, eye depth, malar; mm in GNM's frame); `atlas_report.py` (spread, R2, correlations, heat map);
`atlas_comps.py` (components at -2 / 0 / +2 sigma, front and profile, what each moves most).
Data: /mnt/data/hifipushie/facesliders/out/atlas_3000.npz (c, A, names). Sheets: human_renders/fs_14_gnm_components_00_11.png,
fs_15_gnm_atlas_corr.png, fs_15_gnm_atlas_report.txt.

## What the model can express (3000 heads; R2 = a linear model in the 120 components, held-out 20%)

- Everything read off landmarks or fixed vertex sets is LINEAR in the identity (R2 0.97-1.00): face / jaw / chin /
  nose / brow / eye / lip proportions, lid aperture, vermilion heights, bow depth, lip projection, nostril show (the
  alae over the subnasale), gonion height, ramus angle, eye setback, malar rise. For these a slider can be an exact
  direction in the identity space (the conditional mean), with no morph at all. Their GNM spread (sd, mm): lid aperture
  0.97, upper vermilion 1.23, lower 1.32, bow 0.37, upper lip projection 2.45, lower 3.73, nostril show 1.10, eye
  setback 3.93, malar rise 1.22, gonion height 3.61, ramus angle 3.3 deg, eye tilt 2.1 deg.
- NOT in the identity space:
  - crease height (the lid's own fold turn): R2 0.13. GNM's lids mostly have no fold of their own; the
    turn is found on 100% of heads, but where it sits is noise to the identity. The crease is a residual detail.
  - fold overhang: R2 0.70, coupled to brow ridge (r 0.74) and eye depth (0.66). Partly the identity's (a deeper
    orbit under a heavier brow makes a fold), partly not.
  - lower-lip width (lm 55-59 over the mouth's width): R2 0.99 but sd 0.022: the model hardly varies it. Tess's
    cushion lip (0.40 vs our 0.82) is far outside GNM.
- My nose band widths (radix / dorsum / tip: the forward-facing band's x extent) are unstable measures (dorsum
  defined on 43% of heads, R2 0.2-0.5): a threshold on the normal is the wrong reader. To redo with
  faceslide.nose_widths' half-drop width on a render, or a curvature-based width.

## What moves together (|r| over 3000 heads; fs_15_gnm_atlas_corr.png)

- eye depth ~ eye setback +0.97, ~ bridge height +0.90, ~ brow ridge +0.88; brow ridge ~ eye setback +0.85. Deep-set
  eyes come with a high bridge and a heavy brow in GNM's faces. That is why Tess's "eye_depth + brow_ridge" made her
  heavy and male: the population does not have deep eyes under a light brow, so the identity had to go past 2.6 sigma.
  A deep-set eye under a light brow is a legitimate face but it is a HOLD (condition on brow_ridge), not the free
  direction.
- eye height ~ lid aperture +0.94; eye width ~ eye spacing -0.73.
- lip fullness ~ upper / lower vermilion +0.92; the two vermilions +0.84; lip projection ~ lower lip projection +0.89.
- nose projection ~ nose upturn -0.84, ~ bridge height +0.78; bridge height ~ upper lip projection -0.71.
- jaw width ~ chin width +0.84; face width ~ cranium width +0.83, ~ cheekbone width +0.77; face length ~ nose
  length +0.76.
- fold overhang ~ brow ridge +0.74, ~ eye setback +0.64.
- The first components (fs_14): comp 0 = head size / chin + nose + jaw width; 1 = neck, jaw squareness, nose length;
  2 = the nose's bridge and hump against upturn and lip projection; 3 = face and cranium width; 4 = brow ridge with
  eye depth, cranium height and bridge height (the coupling above); 5 = brow / head depth / eye depth again.

## What it means for the sliders (step 2)

- Sliders on landmark attributes (most of them) become conditional-mean directions in the identity space: one unit
  = the attribute's change, the rest of the face as the population moves with it. Exact (R2 ~ 1).
- A `hold` list conditions on named attributes (eye setback with brow ridge held), replacing blanket held modes.
- Residual morphs stay only for: the crease (no identity), the fold overhang's unexplained 30%, lip roll / eversion
  shape, the lower lip's lateral taper, tip definition, lid-margin detail. Whether a residual correlates with other
  attributes needs measuring the residual on real faces: GNM can't teach it. Data that would: scan sets with lids and
  lips (FaceScape / Headspace-style 3D faces, licence permitting), MakeHuman's eyelid / lip targets for the shape
  vocabulary (CC0), photographs with measured crease heights (oculoplastic literature tables).
