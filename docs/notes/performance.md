# Performance invariants (keep these when changing things)

Moved verbatim from CLAUDE.md on 2026-10-19 (CLAUDE.md slimmed to <8 KB).

- `sdf.field_at` sorts points into Morton-ordered chunks, culls the primitive list per chunk (`_cull`: region
  "intersect" prims always stay) and runs chunks on a thread pool (`_run`; nested calls run inline). Grid
  blocks are processed the same way. Results are identical to the serial path (`_field_serial`).
- `sdf.PartGrid` keeps a part's block grid between builds; `update` diffs primitive fingerprints and redoes
  only blocks in the changed primitives' influence boxes (a shell part also gets its base's changed boxes).
  `store._LIVE` holds these per model plus each part's projected mesh; `_mesh_part` re-meshes and reuses the
  projection of every vertex at the same (quantised) position outside the changed boxes. Incremental builds
  must equal cold builds: compare faces/verts after any change here.
  `PartGrid` records its grid key/fingerprints only after its blocks are filled, and `store.build` holds a
  per-model lock (MCP tools run on worker threads) and drops `_LIVE` if a build fails: a half-updated grid
  (unwritten `np.empty` blocks) meshed into millions of vertices and NaNs that Taubin spread (cabin2, gable).
- `project` uses a tetrahedral stencil (value + gradient in 4 evaluations) and drops converged vertices.
- Displacement strokes query only nearby dab samples (KD-tree, `k` nearest within `radius`).
- Caches keyed by content: `compile_prims`, kit expansion, each stroke's seating, seated joints, KD-trees.
  `expand_mirror` copies structure but shares numeric leaf lists (`_tree_copy`): don't mutate those in place.
- `fit` works on a frozen copy (kits, strokes, seated joints expanded once) and applies the fitted values to
  the real model; its Jacobian recomputes a column only at points a changed primitive can reach.
- Renders go to one persistent headless Blender (`render._Blender`, `blender_render.py --serve`); the stroke
  overlay's visibility is a z-buffer splatted from the built mesh's vertices.
